# general ideas
- use formatting or fmt (instead of format-numbers)

# install
- autodetect nvr
- --nodeps
- --deps
- --srpm
- --exclude vs --except
- tags
- exclude garbage collected builds

# tasks
- determine username for non-Fedora
- build pattern
- different hubs put builds in different locations
- html output
- grep buildlog

# builds
- support latest-build for tag
- --show-tags

# query
- default to the last year? for speed
- --short option
- --active or state filter

# buildlog-sizes/progress
- combine

# progress
- accept task or build url
- cache and compare sizes with previous build(s)

- show the build duration
- support builds as well as tasks
- option to order by log size
- % of previous build (or finished tasks)
- mbs urls?
- average build times? (cache or separate tool?)
- quits during srpm builds
- show log sizes for old finished builds

- display buildtimes for completed tasks

- pick up user's new builds

- screen mode inplace tui

# quickCmd
`quick my last build fail`
